Backbone Koans
==============

Yet another koans-for-learning-backbone.js-project.

Development
-----------

I'm using git to provide a step-by-step solution to the koans,
therefore I frequently change the git history
and you should not expect this git repository to 
follow the usual recommendations about keeping history uforanderlig.
Should anyone be interested in contributing to this project,
please let me know and I'll consider changing 
the development method as discussed in Github issue #4.
